Actually-Barebones-HTML5-Template
=================================

It seems like every HTML5 starter template I've ever used is bloated with crap that I don't ever need and unnecessary comments, Javascript libraries and useless IE fallbacks. No layout is assumed, just a doctype and some meta tags.

There are no bundled libraries, CSS frameworks or anything assumed. This is literally the skeleton of your application, so no need to remove anything you don't need because there's nothing to remove.
