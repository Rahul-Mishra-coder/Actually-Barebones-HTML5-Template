Actually Barebones HTML5 Template
=================================

It seems like every HTML5 starter template I've ever used is bloated with crap that I don't ever need and unnecessary comments, Javascript libraries and useless IE fallbacks. It feels like I spend more time taking things out than I invest putting things in. 

With the HTML5 Barebones Template, no layout is assumed, just a doctype and some meta tags to get you started.

There are no bundled libraries, CSS frameworks or anything assumed. This is literally the skeleton of your application, so no need to remove anything you don't need because there's nothing to remove.

## Why?

Development speed is important. Spend more time building, less time configuring and removing crap. I created this repo because I prototype a lot in HTML and found myself needing a HTML5 skeleton I could build upon.

## Oh, cool

Yeah.

## What is the licence?

There is no licence. This is just an index.html file. Case closed.
